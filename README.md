# What you need
We use Python 3.6.
Make sure that you have a working implementation of PyTorch installed, to do this see: https://pytorch.org/
To visualise progress we use tensorboardX which can be installed using pip:
```
pip install tensorboardX tensorboard
```
No installation is necessary, you can simply run the python code straight from this directory.

# Generating a patch
`patch_config.py` contains configuration of different experiments. You can design your own experiment by inheriting from the base `BaseConfig` class or an existing experiment. `ReproducePaperObj` reproduces the patch that minimizes object score from the paper (With a lower batch size to fit on a desktop GPU).

You can generate this patch by running:
```
python train_patch.py paper_obj
```
